## Effortlessly keep track of 250+ ever-changing APY rates!

This project is **not affiliated with Impermax**, this is not an official release.
___
## Constantly identifying the best APYs on Impermax is a pain.
This tool allows you to effortlessly compare the best APYs over:
- 250+ unique tokens supply and borrow APYs.
- 125+ pairs and their unique leveraged LP APYs.
- 6 blockchains (ETH, MATIC, ARB, AVAX, MOONRIVER, FTM)

### Sample data in the /output folder
You may find examples of .CSV files generated by the script in the ./output directory. I may update it on occasion.

### Example use case: finding the best stable coin to lend.
This is from our dedicated Google Sheets template (linked below). You can directly paste the data there!
> **Filter used**: Only stablecoins with a supply greater than $100k USD over all available blockchains in descending order.**
> 
>*Comment*: DAI from the USDC/DAI pair on SushiSwap on the MATIC chain has the best supply APR, followed by USDC.e from the USDC.e/USDT.e pair on TraderJoe (Avalanche chain).

- Works on: Windows 10 and Ubuntu 21. Untested on other distributions.
- Python 3.9 must be installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/
- Does **not work** with Python 3.10.

#### Optional: the Google Sheets template
Paste the data here after it's been generated (see instructions below): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13dkbAPx0WSgNpDEDPrNTfrGF_QchMh4M1S5suFsAkO4/

### First time installation instructions
___
Create a new folder, then cd into it with the terminal.
Then copy-paste these commands.

  git clone https://github.com/dehidehidehi/impermax_to_csv.git
 ```

```console
  cd impermax_to_csv
  python setup.py install
 ```

### How to retrieve the data
